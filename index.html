			<h5> Film Director, Producer, Screenwriter, Pioneer</h5>
			<div class="container">
				<p class="intro">Alfred Hitchcock is considered by many to be one of the greatest movie directors of all time. He is a pioneer in many aspects of filmaking and earned the nickname "The Master of Suspese". Not only was Hitchcock a master at creating supsense and terror, he was also a technical innovator. Many of his camera techniques are used by the most prominent directors today still.</p>

					<li><strong>1980: </strong>At age 81, Alfred Hitchcock dies of arthritis, liver failure, and slowdown of kidney function.
